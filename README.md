# dotfiles

## My current dotfiles

The Makefile takes care of installing them to the correct place with the proper file names.  

Because vim doesn't seem to like a softlink on ~/.vim/ I copy the entire directory instead.  

Note that none of the files are preceded by a dot, to make them easier to see and edit on a Linux/Un\*x style system.
